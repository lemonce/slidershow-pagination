			HTMLElement.style
			The HTMLElement.style property is used to get as well as set the inline style of an element. 
			While getting, it returns a CSSStyleDeclaration object that contains a list of all styles 
			properties for that element with values assigned for the attributes that are defined in the 
			element's inline style attribute.  See the CSS Properties Reference for a list of the CSS 
			properties accessible via style.The style property has the same (and highest) priority in 
			the CSS cascade as an inline style declaration set via the style attribute.
